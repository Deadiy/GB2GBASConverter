# GB2GBASConverter
This Requires Goomba GB Converter, only works with goomba.gba right now.

This project does the following:
  -searches all .gb and .gbc games in a directory
  -converts them into .gba games with the name of the original file
  -removes whitespaces in the file and path (for more compatability)
  -only runs on windows of right now but python can be run on a raspberry pie
  -each game is converted to it's own .gba file
